# Animal-Quize-Game

## Python quiz game's reasoning

The quiz game quizzes the user on several animal topics. If you wish to avoid making the quiz too challenging, you have three chances to respond to each question. A point is awarded for each right response. The software will display the player's ultimate score after the game.

This quiz game makes use of functions, which are named blocks of code that carry out particular tasks. By using a function, you may reuse the same code repeatedly without having to manually write it all in each time. Although Python comes with a large number of pre-built functions, you can also write your own.

The software should keep checking to see whether there are any more questions to ask and if the player has used up all of his opportunities. In the course of the game, the score is kept in a variable. The game is over when every question has an answer.
